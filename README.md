# Building Systems with the ChatGPT API - DeepLearning.AI Course

This repository contains notes, code examples, and exercises from the **Building Systems with the ChatGPT API** course by [DeepLearning.AI](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/chatgpt-building-system/). This course is designed to help developers effectively use the ChatGPT API to build complex, reliable, and automated systems.

## Course Overview

In this course, we learn how to leverage the ChatGPT API for task automation, enhancing workflows, and improving the quality of language model (LLM) outputs. Key concepts include managing complex tasks, chaining LLM calls, and ensuring output relevance and safety. 

### Topics Covered
1. **Introduction**: Overview of ChatGPT, including tokens, the chat format, and usage basics.
2. **Classification**: Techniques for categorizing and organizing data with ChatGPT.
3. **Moderation**: Applying moderation tools for safe and compliant outputs.
4. **Chain of Thought Reasoning**: Using step-by-step reasoning to enhance response accuracy.
5. **Chaining Prompts**: Combining multiple prompts to complete complex tasks.
6. **Check Outputs**: Ensuring output relevance and reliability.
7. **Evaluation**: Systematic evaluation of LLM inputs and outputs across two parts, focusing on quality and safety.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Structure workflows that involve complex task handling with ChatGPT.
